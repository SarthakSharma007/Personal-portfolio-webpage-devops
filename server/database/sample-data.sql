('Automated Node.js Application Deployment using CI/CD and Kubernetes', 
'This repository includes two key DevOps automation tasks completed during the Elevate Labs DevOps Internship. The first task focuses on automating Node.js application deployment using GitHub Actions and Docker Hub, where a CI/CD pipeline was configured to automatically build and push Docker images on every code update. The second task demonstrates deploying the same containerized Node.js application on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, showcasing concepts like pods, deployments, services, and scaling. Together, these projects highlight a complete workflow from continuous integration to container orchestration.',

This script is ideal for automating daily or periodic backups, organizing data efficiently, and ensuring file safety without the need for external software. It is simple to configure, extend, and integrate into larger automation workflows.',
