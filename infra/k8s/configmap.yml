  # Configuration for the Frontend (less common, but useful if needed)
  # In a React application, these variables are often baked in at build time,
  # but they can be used for runtime configuration if necessary.
  
  # Assuming the frontend needs to know the internal backend service address
  # Note: The REACT_APP_API_URL is typically set directly in the Deployment manifest,
  # but it's listed here for completeness if you prefer using a ConfigMap.
